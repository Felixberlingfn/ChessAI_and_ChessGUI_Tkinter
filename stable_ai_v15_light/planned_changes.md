this is v14 with the alpha beta pruning from v15

something was wrong in v15 and I can't find the issue

I noticed too late because superficially v15 gave the same results

but there is a slight difference in the move sequence even though
it gives the exact same score for the test board, which was just coincidence

----

**v16 will be v14 with**
- all the features added in v15 but
- added carefully
and always checking that the outcome stays the same
- if the new features are turned 
off in the settings!

---
- I still believe that the added features in v15 should improve performance
- I just need to implement them correctly.
