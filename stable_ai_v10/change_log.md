# problematic:
my intention was to prefer more deeply evaluated nodes, but it actually doesn't necessarily.

like if all nodes are bad. the more deep ones are multiplied by say 1.1

so then all deep nodes are even worse

and it would prefer the shallow ones

maybe I should rather give a tiny depth score

but only at the top level

like a really small number that doesn't have too much of an impact

maybe multiply length of the list by 0.1
